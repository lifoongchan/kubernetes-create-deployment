Troubleshooting

1) find busybox
"kubectl get pods"
- show all pods such as busybox in the default namespace

to see if the application (that is not published online) is working:
- i)find a pod's IP address through spinning up busypot
- ii) use Wget to make a get request 

2) connect to a busybox shell
"kubectl exec -it <busybox name> -- /bin/sh"


3) open a new terminal and find ip addresses of pots:
"kubectl get pods -n <development> -o wide"

4) return to busybox shell terminal
"wget <ip address of pot>"
to check if the traffic is working 



types of error:
wget: can't connect to remote host -> need to specify port that container interacts with
wget: can't open "index.html": File exists -> delete the file by rm index.html
then run again

wget defaults to port 80 if no port is specified in yaml


valid namespace YAML:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: mynamespace
